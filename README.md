# Neural Network
This started to build an artificial neural network to complete MNIST handwriting recognition.
The training set uses the official training set file provided by MNIST, with a dimension of 28 * 28 * 60000. The neural network contains an input layer, a hidden layer containing 40 neurons, and an output layer containing 10 neurons. The activation function uses the sigmoid function and uses softmax to classify and calculate the lossã€‚
